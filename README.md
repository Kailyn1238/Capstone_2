# Capstone_2
Welcome to the Project!
Ever wanted to dive into data cleaning and business analysis, but didn’t know where to start? Well, you’re in the right place! This project is all about cleaning up messy customer data and turning raw sales transactions into valuable insights using the power of Python and Pandas. Along the way, we’ll also create charts to visualize our findings.

What’s This Project All About?
This project has two main parts:

Part 1: Customer Data Cleanup
You’ve got customer info—names, phone numbers, SMS opt-out statuses—but it’s all a bit of a mess. Some phone numbers are missing dashes, some customers' names have weird characters, and there are a few blanks in the SMS opt-out column that need attention.

What I Did:

Cleaned up messy names (removed stray characters).
Fixed phone numbers (now they're formatted as NNN-NNN-NNNN).
Filled in missing SMS opt-out values to ensure marketing messages reach the right people.
In short, I turned a messy customer list into something shiny and useful!

Part 2: Sales Transaction Analysis
Next, I analyzed a dataset of 2024 sales transactions. This is about understanding which customers are the biggest spenders, what products are most popular, and how to boost sales. The result? Insights that help your business grow.

What I Did:

Loaded and cleaned the sales data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Aggregated the data to identify top customers and best-selling products.
Created charts to visualize sales trends with clear titles and labels.
