# Capstone_2
This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize business-related data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The focus is on two major components:

Customer Data Cleanup: Automating the cleanup of a customer list with missing or inconsistent data (e.g., phone numbers, SMS opt-out values, and customer names).
Sales Transaction Analysis: Analyzing a dataset of sales transactions to derive insights into customer behavior and business performance, including visualizing the data with charts.
Validate and standardize customer names (handling stray characters).
Correct phone number formats to a standardized NNN-NNN-NNNN format.
Handle missing SMS opt-out values by assigning "N" (opt-in) where appropriate.

Convert raw transaction data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Provide a statistical summary of the data.
Aggregate sales by customer to identify top customers.
Visualize sales data using a bar chart to highlight high-value customers.
